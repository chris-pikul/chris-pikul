# Hi There, I'm Chris Pikul

**Available for hire!**

I'm a coder/developer/programmer/enginner, whichever you prefer. I have ~12 years of experience in development from Full-Stack web/application development, Game development, and general software. My expertise is in Web Development using technologies such as HTML5, CSS3+, JavaScript ES5-ES2021, TypeScript, SASS, Node.JS, React/ReactNative, VueJS, and more. The Back-End technologies I use most is Go, Node.JS, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker/Kubernetes, and more. In Game development and general software I use C++20 the most, but I have experience in C# and Java.

Besides coding, I enjoy music both as a listener and producer occasionaly. As well as digital art. Further more, I love the creativity and infinite story telling of Dungeons & Dragons (I have some tools I've been creating for that as well).

## Noteworthy Projects

* DnDLib - A tested TypeScript library featuring classes and data-containers for all the rules, items, classes, spells, features, etc. of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. Also features a collection of JSON-Schema files for validating serialized data that works with the TypeScript/JavaScript classes. I intend to use this library for future work with my D&D tools, such as a searchable data-base for storing and refering to homebrew content.
* SCNT - A Node.JS based CLI tool for calculating "Lines of Code" and other interesting metrics. Will search and parse directories for source-code files and calculate how many lines of source code, comments, inline vs. block, characters, white-space, and more.
* Mos6502 - A MOS-6502 emulator written in C++17. It iwll parse incoming byte-code (assembly) files and run them as a virtual-machine.
* TS-Toolbox - A collection of useful utilities written in TypeScript. I use this in other projects as a simple, centralized package, of common utilities. It is well-commented, and tested.
* Chroma - TypeScript library for Color data. Includes classes for RGB, HSL, and more color spaces. Allows for manipulation and conversion between color spaces.
* Chromaview - An older project of mine in which I was testing camera video manipulation using Rust & WASM. It uses the live feed, and applies filters in real-time to show the user (like a mirror) of what the world looks like to people with color-blindness.
